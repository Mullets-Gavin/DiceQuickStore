Dice QuickStore was designed as a simple measure to [Dice DataStore](https://github.com/Mullets-Gavin/DiceDataStore) for quickly saving & pulling data with no backup protections. This works great if you are not using it for Player Data, otherwise please use Dice DataStore for all safety net catches.
